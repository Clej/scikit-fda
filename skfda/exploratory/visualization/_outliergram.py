"""Outliergram Module.

This module contains the methods used to plot shapes in order to detect
shape outliers in our dataset. In order to do this, we plot the
Modified Band Depth and Modified Epigraph Index, that will help us detect
these outliers. The motivation of the method is that it is easy to find
magnitude outliers, but there is a necessity of capturing this other type.

    Outliergram method of visualization.

    Plots the Modified Band Depth (MBD) on the Y axis and the Modified
    Epigraph Index (MEI) on the X axis. This points will create the form of
    a parabola. The shape outliers will be the points that appear far from
    this curve.

        fdata: functional data set that we want to examine.
        chart: figure over with the graphs are plotted or axis over
            where the graphs are plotted. If None and ax is also
            None, the figure is initialized.
        fig: figure over with the graphs are plotted in case ax is not
            specified. If None and ax is also None, the figure is
            initialized.
        axes: axis where the graphs are plotted. If None, see param fig.
        n_rows: designates the number of rows of the figure
                to plot the different dimensions of the image. Only specified
                if fig and ax are None.
        n_cols: designates the number of columns of the
                figure to plot the different dimensions of the image. Only
                specified if fig and ax are None.
    Attributes:
        mbd: result of the calculation of the Modified Band Depth on our
            dataset. Represents the mean time a curve stays between other pair
            of curves, being a good measure of centrality.
        mei: result of the calculation of the Modified Epigraph Index on our
            dataset. Represents the mean time a curve stays below other curve.
